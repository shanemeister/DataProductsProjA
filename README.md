# DataProductsProjA

This project is for the Data Products course from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the use of the Shiny programming language, post the Shiny app on Shiny's web site, and present the code here for review by other students.

This project might be nore involved than expected. It takes cleansed data from NOAA, and presents it in a format that is searchable by Decade, Region, and weather Event. The data is presented in three formats:
1. Tablular
2. Heat Map (Density)
3. Storm Distribution Map

However, it was fun and I had the time. Any feedback for improvements will be greatly appreciated. 

If you wanted to use this code, or parts of it, for the Google Maps portion you would need to apply for your own Google API Key. I removed my key from the code. However, all other elements should work fine. 

All files in this repository should be in the same folder, and compiled using RMarkdown.
